# Code of Conduct

At `SimaiParserWithAntlr` community, we are committed to creating a friendly and inclusive community environment where everyone feels welcome to contribute, discuss, and learn.

To achieve this goal, we have established the following code of conduct.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code of conduct is to ensure respect, understanding, and cooperation among community members. We want everyone to participate in the project in a warm and friendly atmosphere, regardless of their background or culture. **While these differences enrich our community, failing to acknowledge them may lead to misunderstandings and unnecessary trouble**.

Therefore, the purpose of this code of conduct is to ensure that our community can coexist harmoniously and develop peacefully.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all community members, **including primary contributors, maintainers and project creators**. Whether it's discussing, contributing code, promoting the project, or engaging in any other project-related activities, everyone should adhere to these guidelines.

## Content of the Code of Conduct

1. **Always Assume Good Intentions:** We encourage community members to always assume good intentions from others. In our communications, we should default to assuming that others' motives are benign, avoiding subjective speculations and negative assumptions.

2. **Be Tolerant of Non-Native English Speakers:** Our community is comprised of individuals from various countries, regions, and linguistic backgrounds. Therefore, when dealing with English content provided by non-native speakers, please maintain tolerance and understanding. Sometimes, their choice of words may not be precise and could alter the tone of a sentence, leading to misunderstandings. We should explain and understand with a friendly and patient attitude.

3. **Allow for Diverse Technical Viewpoints:** We welcome different technical viewpoints and suggestions. Everyone has unique perspectives and experiences, and this diversity is valuable. Therefore, we should respect and accommodate different viewpoints, engage in constructive discussions, and learn from each other to drive the project forward.

4. **Focus on Issues, Not Individuals:** We strictly prohibit personal attacks and hate speech. When discussing issues, we should focus on facts and viewpoints, rather than blaming or attacking individuals. We encourage constructive discussions and criticism but ensure they are conducted with respect and courtesy.

5. **The Golden Rule for Behavior Assessment:** When participating in community activities and interactions, you can ask yourself: will my behavior make the community better or worse? By asking this simple question, you can better evaluate your actions and ensure that our community maintains a positive atmosphere.
